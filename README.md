# About Bytely

<font color='red'>NOTE:</font> This is not a "real" website, it's not hosted anywhere, maybe in the future. If I decide to host it somewhere it will probably not be at ``.com`` but in this README I'll be using it for examples.

This project is *heavily* inspired by [Bitly](https://bitly.com/), hence the name Bytely. The reason as to why I decided to go with that name is because I'm planning to add some additional features, including, but not limited to:

 - **Statistics**: Clicks, percentage by country, how many clicks for every day.
 - **Charts**: Using the above statistics for pie charts, line charts and possibly more.
 - **Custom Links**: Registered users can create custom shortened links  (e.g. `Bytely.com/MyCustomLink`).


# How to install

 - Download the files from the github repository.
 **or**
 - use git - ``git clone https://www.github.com/vincent-gustafsson/bytely``
 - Make sure you have all the libraries installed.
# How to run

 1. Open the terminal.
 2. Make sure you are in the directory that contains the ``run.py`` file.
 3. Type ``python run.py´´
 4. The Flask app will now run on a development server at ``http://127.0.0.1:5000``
